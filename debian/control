Description: Extract monitoring data from logs for collection in a timeseries database
 Mtail is a tool for extracting metrics from application logs to be exported
 into a timeseries database or timeseries calculator for alerting and
 dashboarding.
 .
 It aims to fill a niche between applications that do not export their own
 internal state, and existing monitoring systems, without patching those
 applications or rewriting the same framework for custom extraction glue code.
 .
 Metrics are exported for scraping by a collector as JSON or Prometheus format
 over HTTP, or can be periodically sent to a collectd, StatsD, or Graphite
 collector socket.
