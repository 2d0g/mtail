copy flag tests from mtail_test.sh

standard library, search path

refactor fs and notify into single interface

no trailing newline in parser test, requires changes to expr stmt

parse tree/ast testing, s-expressions to render expected?

mapping between progs and logs to reduce wasted processing

~ and !~ 

define a capref in the same expression it's used: e.g.
  /(?<x>.*)/ && x > 0

conversion in vm.compare() crashes on $var == "string" when $var is
    float (logical.mtail, input line "12.8") -- 

codegen for conditional and jmp is weird for 2-deep trees

Using a const pattern fragment as the first or only in a pattern expr is a
    parse error.
	{"concat expr 1", `
/bar/ + X {
}`},
	{"concat expr 2", `
X {
}`},
	// 	{"match expression 3", `
	// $foo =~ X {
	// }
	// `},

Match against a variable requires simplifying binaryExpr grammar to elim the
    concat_expr branch, fixing the id_expr problem above
	{"match expr 2", `
/(?P<foo>.{6}) (?P<bar>.*)/ {
  $foo =~ $bar {
  }
}`},
